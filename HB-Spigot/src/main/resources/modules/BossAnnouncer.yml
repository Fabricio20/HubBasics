# Enabled (boolean) is the status for this world, usually true (if you set false, why create a section anyway?).
# Time (int) is the amount of ticks to wait before changing.
#   - Ticks = Seconds * 20
#   - (1 Second has 20 ticks)
# Messages is a section containing all messages that are available for that world.
