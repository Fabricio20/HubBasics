# KeepFood per-world configuration.
# Example:
#
# world:
#   Enabled: true
#   Food: 20
#
# Enabled (boolean) is the status for this world, usually true (if you set false, why create a section anyway?).
# Food (integer) is the amount of food to set, normally it's 20 (Full bar).
#
world:
  Enabled: true
  Food: 20
