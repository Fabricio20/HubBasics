# HubBasics ![Build](https://github.com/Fabricio20/HubBasics/workflows/Build/badge.svg) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/99121b8cf6c44a239f16d51420cff7c4)](https://www.codacy.com/app/Fabricio20/HubBasics?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Fabricio20/HubBasics&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

As the name suggests, this plugin is intended for hubs. It gives you the settings and options you as a server owner might desire, and
a few more. Having a million different plugins just for one of their features not only makes your server a complete mess of different
message formats and duplicate features, it makes your server slower. HubBasics has taken all these features and moshed them together
into one plugin.

The rewrite has been completed as of Oct 1st, 2018. The rewrite  branch has been force-pushed to master.
