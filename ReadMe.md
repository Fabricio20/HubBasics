# HubBasics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Fabricio20/HubBasics.svg?branch=rewrite)](https://travis-ci.com/Fabricio20/HubBasics) [![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/99121b8cf6c44a239f16d51420cff7c4)](https://www.codacy.com/app/Fabricio20/HubBasics?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=Fabricio20/HubBasics&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

As the name suggests, this plugin is intended for hubs. It gives you the settings and options you as a server owner might desire, and
a few more. Having a million different plugins just for one of their features not only makes your server a complete mess of different
message formats and duplicate features, it makes your server slower. HubBasics has taken all these features and moshed them together
into 1 plugin.

A complete rewrite is in progress, and will be released soon as version 7.0. You can find the spigot page for HubBasics [HERE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hubbasics.2654/)
