# HubBasics [![Build Status](http://jenkins.notfab.net/job/HubBasics/badge/icon)](http://jenkins.notfab.net/job/HubBasics/)

As the name suggests, this plugin is intended for hubs. It gives you the settings and options you as a server owner might desire, and
a few more. Having a million different plugins just for one of their features not only makes your server a complete mess of different
message formats and duplicate features, it makes your server slower. HubBasics has taken all these features and moshed them together
into 1 plugin.

A complete rewrite is in progress, version 5.0. Spigot page can be found here; https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hubbasics.2654/
