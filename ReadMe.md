# HubBasics [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Fabricio20/HubBasics.svg?branch=rewrite)](https://travis-ci.com/Fabricio20/HubBasics)

As the name suggests, this plugin is intended for hubs. It gives you the settings and options you as a server owner might desire, and
a few more. Having a million different plugins just for one of their features not only makes your server a complete mess of different
message formats and duplicate features, it makes your server slower. HubBasics has taken all these features and moshed them together
into 1 plugin.

A complete rewrite is in progress, and will be released soon as version 5.0. You can find the spigot page for HubBasics [HERE](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hubbasics.2654/)
